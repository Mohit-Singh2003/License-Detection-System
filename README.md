# License Plate Detection Using YOLOv5

## Project Overview
This project implements a license plate detection system using YOLOv5, compatible with both Raspberry Pi and standard PCs. The system is designed to detect and recognize license plates in real-time video feeds.

## Features
- Real-time license plate detection
- Compatible with Raspberry Pi and standard PCs
- Utilizes the YOLOv5 model for accurate detection
- Integration with Tesseract OCR for text recognition

## Requirements

### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi 3 or later / Any standard PC with a webcam

### Software
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- Tesseract OCR
- Ultralytics YOLOv5
